# AGENTS.md

Rules for every agent and person who changes this repository. The full
release mechanism is described in the Woow_HA_App_Store README (section
"版本策略與同步") and in ADR-0005 of the WOOW addon pipeline.

1. **``main`` only changes through a pull request.** A ruleset blocks direct
   pushes, force pushes and deleting the branch, and nobody can bypass it.
   Push a branch, open a PR, wait for the required checks, then merge.
2. **A PR that changes an addon version is a release.** Merging it publishes
   that version to the WOOW App Store. It must pass every required check; the
   checks are the approval, there is no human review step. Every PR runs
   `Upgrade comparison / compare` (pipeline #89); treat a failure as blocking.
   It compares each addon whose version the PR changes with the latest Stable
   Release. A PR that changes no version passes it in seconds. The result is
   in the job summary. It also runs the upgrade test (pipeline #144): the Store
   rebuilds the latest Release and the PR for amd64, starts the Release under a
   mock Supervisor, then the PR's version on the same data, and fails when
   either does not start (here: the ingress port 3000 answers and the
   container stays up). It also checks data (pipeline #151) with the hooks in
   `headscale/upgrade-check/`: `seed` takes the add-on's API key from
   `/_ha_key` on the ingress port and, through Headscale's REST API on port
   8080, creates a user and a reusable pre-auth key on the Release; `verify`
   checks on this PR's version that the add-on still serves the same API key
   and it authenticates, that the user and the pre-auth key are still there
   unchanged, and that a new user can be created. Keep them working when you
   change the API port, `/_ha_key`, the nginx allow rule for the Supervisor
   address or the data directory; a failing check blocks the release. The
   hook interface (environment, JSON report) is in the Woow_HA_App_Store
   README, "第 2 類 升級測試", paragraph "資料檢查（#138）". Keep the hooks
   executable (`git update-index --chmod=+x`), with LF endings and a `#!` of
   python3 or busybox sh only (no bash): they run in the Store's
   python:3.12-alpine mock Supervisor container, so never `docker run` from
   them. A hook must not leave background processes running when it exits,
   and a hook file must not be a symlink to anything outside `upgrade-check/`
   (only that directory is mounted). An optional
   `headscale/upgrade-check/settings.yaml` sets `startup_timeout`,
   `stable_seconds` and `hook_timeout` (positive integer seconds);
   `hook_timeout` defaults to 600 and covers the whole `docker exec` of a
   hook. The Store registry sets `data_check_due: "2026-12-29"` for this addon
   (pipeline #141): from the next day (UTC), a version bump without a `verify`
   hook fails, so do not remove it.
3. **Breaking changes must be declared in `upgrade-notes.yaml`** next to the
   addon's `config.yaml` (here `headscale/upgrade-notes.yaml`). Create the
   file only when the upgrade comparison asks for it; copy `change` and `key`
   from its report and write the migration path. The addons here are built on
   the device, so the vulnerability comparison does not run for them yet
   (pipeline #90). The release puts these entries on the GitHub Release.
   Rules, change names and the file format: the Woow_HA_App_Store README,
   section "升版比對與 `upgrade-notes.yaml`".
